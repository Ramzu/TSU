TSU Commodities Program

Unlock the True Value of Your Resources

What Is the TSU Commodities Program?

The TSU Commodities Program is designed for producers, exporters, and traders who hold valuable resources but face challenges converting them into stable liquidity. By registering unsold or allocated commodities (oil, cocoa, copper, grain, and more) with the TSU Authority, you gain access to Trade Settlement Units (TSU) â€” a digital settlement token backed by real reserves.

How It Works

1. Register Your Commodities
Producers submit proof of ownership (allocation contracts, warehouse receipts, or export rights). Independent Trustees verify and secure the assets.

2. TSU Issuance with Lock-Up
TSU credits are minted against your registered commodity value. For security, these credits remain locked for 30â€“60 days while the Authority builds FX and gold reserves.

3. Reserve Building
During lock-up, TSU is offered to investors and BRICS partners. Proceeds strengthen the reserve pool (gold, foreign currency, and other commodities).

4. Unlock & Redeem
Once the lock-up expires, your TSU is unlocked. You can:

Pay for imports and business supplies

Redeem TSU for BRICS currencies (CNY, ZAR, RUB, INR)

Exchange for gold or other commodities in the system

Why Participate?
For Producers

Liquidity Today â€“ Turn unsold assets into usable settlement units.

Stability â€“ TSU is pegged to a diversified basket of gold, FX, and commodities.

Market Access â€“ Expand beyond USD bottlenecks into BRICS and African demand.

For Traders

Reliable Supply â€“ Source commodities through a transparent, reserve-backed system.

De-Dollarized Settlement â€“ Transact in TSU instead of relying on USD channels.

Verified Assets â€“ All commodities are independently validated before issuance.

Safeguards You Can Trust

Over-Collateralization: Producers pledge 120â€“150% of the value of TSU minted.

Independent Trustees: All assets are validated by neutral third parties.

Proof-of-Reserves: Monthly audits published for transparency.

International Arbitration: Neutral dispute resolution protects all partners.

Example

A cocoa cooperative registers 50,000 tons of cocoa worth $100M.

TSU worth $70M is minted and locked for 45 days.

During lock-up, reserves are raised in CNY and gold.

After unlock, the cooperative uses TSU to buy tractors from China and fertilizer from South Africa.
