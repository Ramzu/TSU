TSU Currency Program

Transform Local Currency Into Global Trade Power

What Is the TSU Currency Program?

Many companies, cooperatives, and even governments hold large balances of local currency that are hard to redeem for USD or other foreign exchange. Inflation, capital controls, and liquidity shortages mean those funds often sit idle while businesses struggle to import critical goods.

The TSU Currency Program solves this problem by converting illiquid local currency into Trade Settlement Units (TSU) â€” a stable, reserve-backed settlement instrument usable across Africa and BRICS trade corridors.

How It Works

1. Deposit Local Currency Into Escrow
Companies deposit their local currency (e.g., ZWL, NGN, PKR, TRY, etc.) into a designated escrow account with a partner bank or trustee.

2. TSU Issuance with Lock-Up
TSU credits are minted and credited to your account, pegged to the reserve basket (gold, BRICS FX, commodities). For system stability, your TSU credits remain locked for 30â€“60 days, giving the Authority time to raise foreign reserves.

3. Reserve Building
During the lock-up, the TSU Authority sells TSU to investors and BRICS buyers, raising hard FX (CNY, ZAR, INR, RUB) and gold. This ensures redemption is fully backed.

4. Unlock & Redeem
After lock-up, your TSU is unlocked. You can:

Pay for imports (fuel, machinery, food, medicine).

Redeem TSU for BRICS foreign currencies.

Convert TSU into gold or commodities within the system.

Why Participate?
For Companies

Monetize Idle Currency â€“ Turn trapped local funds into usable trade value.

Secure Imports â€“ Use TSU to directly pay international suppliers.

Stability â€“ Protect your purchasing power with a basket pegged to gold, FX, and commodities.

For Governments & Banks

Relieve Forex Pressure â€“ Ease USD shortages by channeling local deposits into TSU.

Support Local Industry â€“ Provide companies with access to imports without draining national reserves.

Increase Confidence â€“ Demonstrate transparent reserve backing and international arbitration safeguards.

Safeguards You Can Trust

Over-Collateralization: Escrow deposits may exceed the TSU value issued (120â€“150%) to cover risk.

Independent Trustees: Local banks or neutral entities hold deposits securely.

Proof-of-Reserves: Monthly audits published to ensure transparency.

Lock-Up Window: Provides stability and ensures reserve buildup before TSU circulation.

Example

A Nigerian manufacturer holds â‚¦20B naira in bank accounts but cannot source USD for spare parts.

The company deposits the funds into a TSU escrow account.

TSU worth $15M is minted and locked for 30 days.

During lock-up, TSU Authority raises $15M equivalent in CNY and gold.

After unlock, the company uses TSU to import machinery from China and chemicals from South Africa.
